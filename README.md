# GpcShoppingCart

Hello GPC! Thanks for taking the time to review my coding exercise! I chose to do Exercise #2 (Sales Taxes)

## Testing out the project

- After pulling down this repo, navigate to the root of the project folder
- Run `ng serve` in your terminal and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Notes

- I've added txt files for the 3 example inputs provide in the coding exercise instructions. They are located in the "src/app/test-files" folder
